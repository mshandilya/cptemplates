# CP Templates

## Overview: 
This repository contains all the templates I (@mshandilya) generally use. Feel free to use the code for your own templates! Read below for more info

## Inspiration:
Commonly used data structures and algorithms in competitive programming are just painful to implement repeatedly. So, to reduce the pain, it is must to have pre-written templates!

## Note:
Templates are still being added and the ones which are present in the main branch have been tested against multiple CP problems from reputed sites. However, it is possible that one finds some error which had been overlooked previously or has a better idea for implementing some part of the code while still retaining the spirit or purpose of the data structure or algorithm. In such a case, I request you to please submit your suggestions to me.

The content / code has been inspired by some external resources which are particularly mentioned in the .md files corresponding a source code file. Currently all source code is / will be written in C++ and there are no plans in the near future to include other programming languages. Other than that enjoy using the resource.
